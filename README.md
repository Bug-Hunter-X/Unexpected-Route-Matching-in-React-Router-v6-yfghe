This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in React Router DOM v6 related to unexpected route matching when using nested routes and a catch-all route ("*)". The issue arises when a nested route's path partially overlaps with the catch-all route, leading to incorrect component rendering.  The `bug.js` file showcases the problem, while `bugSolution.js` provides a solution using more precise route definitions.
